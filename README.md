# Hi there, I'm Mohamed Ghouila 👋

🎓 **Engineer in Applied Mathematics and AI, studying at INSA Toulouse.**  
I specialize in Deep Reinforcement Learning and Data Science with a passion for solving complex real-world problems. 

## 🚀 About Me
I am a motivated final-year engineering student with a deep interest in AI, data science, and mathematical modeling. My experience includes working on deep learning models for control systems, natural language processing, and image analysis. I'm also skilled in full-stack development, with projects involving Flask and Docker.

## 🛠️ What I Do
- **Deep Reinforcement Learning**: Currently applying deep RL for estimating bedrock beneath the Antarctic ice sheet.
- **Data Science & Machine Learning**: Hands-on experience with data preprocessing, model building, and fine-tuning neural networks.
- **Full Stack Development**: I’ve developed web applications and deployed models using Flask and Docker.

## 💼 Professional Experience
- **Deep Reinforcement Learning Intern**, CNRS Toulouse _(June 2024 - Sept 2024)_
  - Mastered key algorithms (PPO, DQN, Actor-Critic) and developed models in TensorFlow and PyTorch.
- **Data Analyst Intern**, Directorate General of Public Service _(July 2022 - Aug 2022)_
  - Applied statistical methods and data exploration techniques for public service profiling.

## 🌟 Projects
- **Antarctic Bedrock Estimation**: Applied deep RL and autoencoders for estimating bedrock under the Antarctic ice sheet.
- **Image Colorization**: Developed an AI model for colorizing black-and-white images, with a Flask web app deployed using Docker.
- **Object Detection with YOLO**: Built an object detection model for both images and video data.

## 🔧 Skills
- **Programming**: Python, TensorFlow, PyTorch, Docker, Flask, SQL, C++, Git.
- **AI & Machine Learning**: CNNs, RNNs, NLP, Reinforcement Learning, Data Augmentation, Transfer Learning.
- **Cloud & Deployment**: Google Cloud, MlOps, Docker, CI/CD Pipelines.
