# Hi there, I'm Mohamed Ghouila 👋

🎓 **Engineer in Applied Mathematics and AI, studying at INSA Toulouse.**  

I am a passionate 5th-year Engineering Student specializing in **Applied Mathematics** at **INSA Toulouse**. My key focus areas are **Deep Reinforcement Learning**, **Machine Learning**, and **Data Science**. I have hands-on experience in building complex AI models and applying advanced algorithms to solve real-world problems, especially in Deep RL. Currently, I am seeking a 6-month final-year internship starting in February or March 2024.

### 🔬 What I Do
- **Deep Reinforcement Learning**: Mastered key algorithms such as PPO, DQN, and Actor-Critic, applying them in research at CNRS Toulouse. Currently working on using Deep RL and autoencoders to estimate bedrock beneath the Antarctic ice sheet.
- **Machine Learning & Data Science**: Developed solutions in **image colorization**, **object detection** (Fast R-CNN, YOLO), and **natural language processing** (BERT, text classification).
- **Model Deployment**: Proficient in deploying AI models using **Flask**, **Docker**, and cloud platforms like **Google Cloud**.

### 🛠 Professional Experience
- **Deep Reinforcement Learning Intern, CNRS Toulouse (June 2024 - September 2024)**  
  Worked on optimizing control problems using Deep RL, with a focus on physics-based inverse problems.
- **IT Support Service Agent (August 2019 - September 2019)**  
  Maintained IT systems and ensured data confidentiality.

### 🔧 Projects
- **Image Colorization**: Created and deployed a WebApp for image colorization using Flask and Docker.
- **Object Detection**: Detected objects using Fast R-CNN for images and YOLO for video-based applications.
- **Deep RL in Antarctica**: Applied Deep Reinforcement Learning and autoencoders to estimate bedrock under the Antarctic ice sheet.
- **NLP Pipeline**: Built a complete text preprocessing and classification pipeline using BERT, including fine-tuning and vectorization.

### 🚀 Skills
- **Technical**: Deep Reinforcement Learning, NLP, CNNs, RNNs, Recommendation Systems, Docker, Flask, MlOps, Google Cloud.
- **Programming**: Python, SQL, C, C++, Java, R, Git, PHP.
- **Soft Skills**: Clear communication, adaptability, teamwork, critical thinking.

### 📚 Education
- **INSA Toulouse**: Engineering in Applied Mathematics (2022 - 2025)
- **Université Claude Bernard, Lyon 1**: Preparatory Cycle MP (2020 - 2022)

### 🌍 Languages
- **French**: Advanced (C1)
- **English**: Advanced (925/990 TOEIC)
- **Arabic**: Native

### ⚡ Fun Fact
- I’m an active participant in programming forums and play volleyball regularly in my free time.
