# Hi there, I'm Mohamed Ghouila 👋

🎓 **Engineer in Applied Mathematics and AI, studying at INSA Toulouse.**  

I am a passionate 5th-year Engineering Student specializing in **Applied Mathematics** at **INSA Toulouse**. My key focus areas are **Deep Reinforcement Learning**, **Machine Learning**, and **Data Science**. I have hands-on experience in building complex AI models and applying advanced algorithms to solve real-world problems, especially in Deep RL. Currently, I am seeking a 6-month final-year internship starting in February or March 2024.

### 🔬 What I Do
I apply a consistent, domain‑agnostic AI workflow to solve real‑world problems across physics, vision, telecom and NLP:
- Frame & Prep: turn real‑world requirements (physics, vision, telecom, text) into clear objectives and normalize diverse data (signals, images, logs, text).  
- Architect & Train: adapt core AI blocks—autoencoders & contrastive nets for features, PPO/DQN for control, YOLO for vision, transformers for language—to each domain’s needs.  
- Optimize & Deploy: quantize & containerize (Flask/FastAPI + Docker), enabling real‑time inference on standard hardware or cloud
- Monitor & Iterate: track key metrics, identify edge‑case failures, and rapidly retrain or fine‑tune for production reliability

### 🛠 Professional Experience
- **Deep Reinforcement Learning Intern, CNRS Toulouse (June 2024 - September 2024)**  
  Worked on optimizing control problems using Deep RL, with a focus on physics-based inverse problems.
- **IT Support Service Agent (August 2019 - September 2019)**  
  Maintained IT systems and ensured data confidentiality.

### 🔧 Projects
- **Deep Reinforcement Learning**: Implemented and tested PPO and DQN variants for inverse modeling of ice–rock interactions at CNRS Toulouse.  
- **Machine Learning & Computer Vision**: Deployed a Flask + Docker WebApp for real‑time detection of micro‑fissures (YOLOv5 + contrastive encoder) on industrial video streams.  
- **Retrieval‑Augmented Generation**: Built a pipeline combining dense vector search and an LLM to answer technical FAQs within Orange’s network tools.  
- **Antarctic Bedrock Estimator**: Autoencoder + PPO pipeline to map ice–rock interfaces.  

### 🚀 Skills
- **Technical**: Deep Reinforcement Learning, NLP, CNNs, RNNs, Recommendation Systems, Docker, Flask, MlOps, Google Cloud.
- **Programming**: Python, SQL, C, C++, Java, R, Git, PHP.
- **Soft Skills**: Clear communication, adaptability, teamwork, critical thinking.

### 📚 Education
- **INSA Toulouse**: Engineering in Applied Mathematics (2022 - 2025)
- **Université Claude Bernard, Lyon 1**: Preparatory Cycle MP (2020 - 2022)

### 🌍 Languages
- **French**: Advanced (C1)
- **English**: Advanced (925/990 TOEIC)
- **Arabic**: Native

### ⚡ Fun Fact
- I’m an active participant in programming forums and play volleyball regularly in my free time.
